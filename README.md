# Zeta-Zen VM Project

## Overview
Zeta-Zen VM is a Python-based application with modules for utility functions, custom logging, configuration handling, and testing. It uses a virtual environment for dependency management and provides a modular architecture for integrating with various external systems like Kafka.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (venv)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd zeta-zen-vm
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv proto/proto-env
source proto/proto-env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `proto\proto-env\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install the `zzv` Package Locally
To install the `zzv` package for use in other projects like `zzv-streamer`, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This command installs `zzv` as an editable package, allowing you to make changes to the `zzv` source code and have them reflected immediately without reinstallation.

### 5. Using the `zzv` Package in Other Projects
Once installed, you can import and use `zzv` in other Python projects as follows:

```python
from zzv.common import logger_ai
from zzv.msgcore import kafka_producer, kafka_consumer
```

You can now build projects like `zzv-streamer` that depend on the `zzv` package.

## Configuration
Logging configuration is located in `config/logger_config.json`. Modify it as needed.

## Usage
To run the application:
```bash
python -m zeta-zen-vm
```

## Building the Project as an Executable

### Using PyInstaller (Recommended)

`PyInstaller` is a tool that bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. This allows you to distribute the project as a standalone executable.

#### Windows

1. **Install PyInstaller:**

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the Executable:**

   Run the following command from the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name zzv --distpath dist --paths . --hidden-import zzv zzv/examples/basic_usage.py
   ```

   - `--onefile`: Creates a single standalone executable.
   - `--name zzv`: Sets the name of the executable to `zzv`.
   - `--distpath dist`: Outputs the executable to the `dist/` directory.
   - `zzv/examples/basic_usage.py`: The path to the script you want to convert into an executable.

3. **Copy Configuration Directory:**

   After building the executable, copy the `config` directory to the `dist` directory as follows:

   ```
   cp -r zeta-zen-vm/config dist/config
   ```

   This step is crucial as the application requires configuration files located in the `config` directory to run properly.

4. **Run the Executable:**

   After copying the configuration directory, you can run the `zzv.exe` file inside the `dist/` directory:

   ```bash
   dist/zzv.exe
   ```

#### Linux and macOS

1. **Install PyInstaller:**

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Build the Executable:**

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --name zzv --distpath dist --paths . --hidden-import zzv zzv/examples/basic_usage.py
   ```

3. **Copy Configuration Directory:**

   After building the executable, copy the `config` directory to the `dist` directory as follows:

   ```bash
   cp -r zeta-zen-vm/config dist/config
   ```

4. **Run the Executable:**

   On Linux and macOS, the executable will be named `zzv` (without the `.exe` extension). Navigate to the `dist` directory and run:

   ```bash
   ./dist/zzv
   ```

### Accessing the Swagger UI

After starting the application, you can access the Swagger UI to test the API endpoints:

1. Open a browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

2. You should see a Swagger UI interface that allows you to interact with the API. For example, you can test the health check endpoint (`/health`) by clicking on it and then clicking the `Try it out` button.

**Example Output:**
```

```

### Additional Options for Building
- To include additional directories or modules, use the `--add-data` or `--hidden-import` options:

  ```bash
  pyinstaller --onefile --name zzv --distpath dist --add-data "zzv/config:zzv/config" --hidden-import "zzv.common" zzv/examples/basic_usage.py
  ```

## Version Management and Package Updates

### 1. Update the `zzv` Package Version
Whenever you make changes or add new functionality, update the `version` field in the `setup.py` file:

```python
setup(
    name='zzv',
    version='0.2.0',  # Increment the version number
    # Other setup configurations...
)
```

### 2. Reinstall the Updated Package
After updating the `setup.py` file, reinstall the `zzv` package:

```bash
pip uninstall zzv
pip install -e .
```

This ensures that the new version of `zzv` is installed in your environment.

### 3. Pull the New Version in Dependent Projects
If you’re using `zzv` in other projects like `zzv-streamer`, upgrade to the latest version:

1. **If using a direct path:**

   ```bash
   pip install -e /path/to/updated/zzv
   ```

2. **If `zzv` is hosted in a repository or PyPI:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade zzv
   ```

### 4. Publish to PyPI (Optional)
To publish a new version to PyPI:

1. Update `version` in `setup.py`.
2. Build the package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist

_wheel
   ```

3. Upload using `twine`:

   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

Ensure `twine` is installed:

```bash
pip install twine
```

This makes the new version available on PyPI for use in other projects.
